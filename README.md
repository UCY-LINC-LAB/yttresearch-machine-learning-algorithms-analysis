Machine Learning Algorithms Experimentation for Popularity and Virality Predictions 
====================

## Research Interface

```bash
The "Research Interface" contains the final source code of our research
regarding Machine Learning Algorithms along with a simple User Interface
to allow experimentation with a variety of algorithms.
```

## Feature Analysis

```bash
Feature Analysis is a project that analyses raw data exported from our research
experiments and produces the appropriate output which is later used to
train our classifiers. 

It produces the appropriate output according to the following input:

  * Days for recent/other separation
  * Training Window
  * Offset
  * Labeling Window
  * Labeling Percentage
```
## Doc

```bash
Detailed documentation about the part of our research that is related
to Machine Learning Experimentation
```

## Testing

```bash
Any changes to the source code are first published here to fix any bugs, 
undergo testing and ensure that the results of the machine learning algorithms 
are 100% valid before they are moved to the Research Interface.
```
